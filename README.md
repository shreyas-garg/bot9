#Hotel Chatbot
This project is a hotel chatbot application that uses the OpenAI API to provide a conversational interface for hotel services. The project is structured into backend and frontend directories, with the backend running on Node.js and the frontend built with React.

#File Structure
scss
Copy code
hotel-chatbot/
│
├── backend/
│   └── server.js
│
└── frontend/
    └── src/
        └── (React project files)
#Backend
The backend is built using Node.js and handles API requests to OpenAI for processing the chatbot conversations.

#Installation
Navigate to the backend directory:

bash
Copy code
cd hotel-chatbot/backend
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Usage
Create a .env file in the backend directory with your OpenAI API key:

makefile
Copy code
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
Start the backend server:

bash
Copy code
node server.js
server.js
This file contains the server code that interacts with the OpenAI API. It listens for incoming requests from the frontend, forwards them to OpenAI, and sends the response back to the frontend.

#Frontend
The frontend is built using React and provides the user interface for interacting with the chatbot.

#Installation
Navigate to the frontend directory:

bash
Copy code
cd hotel-chatbot/frontend
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Usage
Start the frontend development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
src
This directory contains the React components and other files needed for the frontend application.

#How to Use
Ensure both the backend and frontend servers are running.
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to interact with the hotel chatbot.
